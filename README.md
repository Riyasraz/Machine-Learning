# Machine Learning Project 

## Outlier Detection and Removal

1.In this project, we aim to detect and remove outliers from the dataset using various methods:

2.Mean Function: Outliers will be identified by comparing data points with the mean of the dataset.

3.Percentile Method: Outliers will be detected based on their position relative to the data distribution using percentiles.

4.Interquartile Range (IQR) Method: Outliers will be identified using the IQR, which is the range between the first and third quartiles of the data.

5.Normal Distribution: Outliers will be detected based on their deviation from the normal distribution assumption.

Z-score Method: Outliers will be identified by calculating the z-score of each data point and comparing it to a threshold.
