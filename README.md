## Outlier Detection and Removal

1.In this project, we aim to detect and remove outliers from the dataset using various methods:

2.Mean Function: Outliers will be identified by comparing data points with the mean of the dataset.

3.Percentile Method: Outliers will be detected based on their position relative to the data distribution using percentiles.

4.Interquartile Range (IQR) Method: Outliers will be identified using the IQR, which is the range between the first and third quartiles of the data.

5.Normal Distribution: Outliers will be detected based on their deviation from the normal distribution assumption.

Z-score Method: Outliers will be identified by calculating the z-score of each data point and comparing it to a threshold.

## Hypothesis Testing

##Q1: Child Psychologist's Claim ##
A child psychologist claims that the average time working mothers spend talking to their children is at least 11 minutes per day. We conduct a random sample of 1000 working mothers and find they spend an average of 11.5 minutes per day talking with their children.

Population Standard Deviation: 2.3 minutes
Sample Size: 1000
Sample Mean: 11.5 minutes
Significance Level: α = 0.05
We perform a hypothesis test to determine if there is enough evidence to support the psychologist's claim.

##Q2: Coffee Shop's Claim ##
A coffee shop claims that their average wait time for customers is less than 5 minutes. To test this claim, a sample of 40 customers is taken, and their wait times are recorded.

Sample Size: 40
Sample Mean Wait Time: 4.6 minutes
Sample Standard Deviation: 0.8 minutes
Significance Level: α = 0.05
We perform a hypothesis test to determine if there is enough evidence to support the coffee shop's claim.
